## Automate the Tedious with Thor

Are you sick of googling for snippets, when all you want to do is to start a new application? Do you dread setting up a new server, because you always forget to add some option or some file? Don't be, use generators!

We are all used to the Rails generators, but, there are tasks to do outside of Rails too. We can use Thor to generate configuration files for Nginx, Apache, Amazon EC2, etc. We can initialize our scripts, presentations, and documents. We can avoid writing boilerplate over and over again. 

In this presentation you will learn how to write generators with Thor, the generator engine that is used for writing the Rails generators. Free yourself to focus on the important with automation!
